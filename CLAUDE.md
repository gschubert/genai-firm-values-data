# Goals
 - I am trying to build a website that hosts the data sets currently shown on this website: https://sites.google.com/view/gregorschubert/data?authuser=0
 - We are only interested in the occupation exposure and firm exposure data on that site
 - Create a clean, attractive, but academically serious website
 - The website is meant for journalists and researchers who want to get a high level overview over the project and use the data, so it should provide some basic information, the data and maybe a graph or two from the paper "Generative AI and Firm Values" for illustration

# Data sources
 - The data are currently sitting on Github and need to be downloaded to the /data folder
 - The paper it is from is as a Tex file in the /paper folder
 - The figures that might be included on the site from the paper are also in the /paper folder

 

# Other instructions
 - Host the website using Vercel
 - Create a clean, attractive, but academically serious website
 - Keep a progress.md log of all choices, make sure to document all choices and progress made there so no information is lost if the conversation ends for some reason
